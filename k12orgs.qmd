# Data prep

This dataset is of all the individuals that have graduated from a high school in Southern Minnesota (as defined by the project). While preparing the K12Enrollment data, I already joined the organizational data and created a dataset that has all the individuals that graduated from a school located in the Northwest region.

<br>

```{r k12org master}
original <- read_csv("Data/SLEDS/Masters/k12_enrollment.csv")

kable(head(original))

kable(names(original))


```

<br>

The one metric that wasn't included when I joined the enrollment data with the organizational data is the number of years they attended a school in the Northwest region (as defined by the project).

# Summary of K12Org

Lets summarize the graduates to see their high schools rural-ness and location. In addition, now that we have joined the graduates and high school location together, we can see if there are any statistically significant differences in the percentage of students based on the demographic information (female, free or reduced free lunch, etc...).

## Summary of high school location

Lets breakdown the graduates by which regions they graduated from.

Over half of students graduated from a county labeled as town/rural mix, while 18% graduated from a urban/town/rural mix, 15% from an entirely urban county, and 10% from entirely rural.

<br>

```{r prep k12orgs summary, include=FALSE}
k12.org.summary.ruca <- master %>%
  tabyl(Dem_Desc) %>%
  select(Dem_Desc, n, percent) %>%
  mutate(percent = scales::percent(percent, accuracy = .1))

k12.org.summary.edr <- master %>%
  tabyl(edr) %>%
  select(edr, n, percent) %>%
  mutate(percent = scales::percent(percent, accuracy = .1)) %>%
  filter(edr != "Minnesota")
```

```{r table k12orgs ruca summary, echo=FALSE}
datatable(k12.org.summary.ruca, class = "cell-border stripe", filter = "top")

```

<br>

Below is a map with the percentages of graduates graduating from high schools located within each county. The schools with the highest percent of graduates/observations are located in Clay with 15% followed by Otter Tail with 14% and Beltrami with 11%. All other counties ranged from 1.5% to 10% of the graduates.

<br>

```{r map k12orgs summary county, echo=FALSE}

k12.org.summary.county <- master %>%
  tabyl(county.name) %>%
  left_join(counties.regions, by = c("county.name" = "Name")) %>%

## Summary of student demographics

The following analysis looks to see if there are any statistical differences due to rural-ness and geographic location of the high school for the following graduate demographics;

-   Were eligible for free or reduced lunch at some point in the dataset
-   Are Female
-   Have been homeless at some point in the dataset
-   Had limited english proficiency at some point in the dataset
-   Had non english speakders in home at some point in the dataset
-   Participated in a PSEO course at some point in the dataset.

Lets start with the cross-tabs based on RUCA categories.

The cross-tabs below indicate that there are 4 demographic variables that have proportions statistically different across RUCA categories. Each of the variables are indicated with an asterisk.

-   Free or reduced lunch: a statistically significant higher percentage of graduates from high schools in entirely rural mix counties receive free or reduced lunch.
-   Homeless: as a school district becomes more urban, the percentage of it's graduates indicating they experienced homeslessness at some point increases significantly.
-   PSEO: a siginficantly lower percentage of graduates from entirely rural districts participated in a PSEO program.

::: panel-tabset
### RUCA Free or Reduced Lunch

Although 35.5% of the total number of graduates in the data set receive free or reduced lunch, graduates from entirely rural schools had significantly higher percentage with 43%, and entirely urban schools had significantly lower share of graduates with 28%.

### RUCA non-english in home

Similar to above, the entirely urban graduates had significantly higher percentage of individuals indicating that someone in their home was a non-english speaker with 8%. Entirely rural districts had 1% of their graduates categorized the same.

### RUCA PSEO

Although 37.3% of all graduates participating in PSEO, there was a significantly lower percentage in entirely urban schools (20.0%).

# Summary of years attended

First, lets see the distribution of the number of years attending a Northwest High School within this dataset.

A large majority of students (\~60,000 students) attended a Northwest MN High School for 3 years. A few attended for longer than that, which is largely due to students who attended a CTE course after they graduated for special training.

<br>

```{r n years attending distribution}
n.years.distribution.map <- ggplot(master, aes(n.years.attended)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    labs(x="", y = "", color="", title = "Distribution of the number of years attending a\nNorthwest MN High School in dataset")+
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::comma)+
  theme_bar + 
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          text = element_text(size = 16))


girafe(ggobj = n.years.distribution.map) %>%
  girafe_options(opts_selection(type = "none"),
                 opts_sizing(rescale = FALSE))

```

<br>

Next, we will look at the summary statistics for the entire dataset.

As expected, the median is 3 years while the average was exactly the same with 3.00 years.

<br>

```{r years attended summary statisics}
n.years.attended.summary.total <- master %>%
  summarise(n = comma(n(), accuracy = 1),
            mean = comma(mean(n.years.attended), accuracy = .01),
            median = comma(median(n.years.attended), accuracy = 1),
            standard.deviation = comma(sd(n.years.attended), accuracy = 0.01)) 

datatable(n.years.attended.summary.total,
          options = list(
            columnDefs = list(list(className = "dt-center", targets = 1:4))
          ))
```

<br>

Next we will check to see if there are any significant differences by using the t-test for the mean by RUCA groups as well as a summary for each of the RUCA groups.

The ANOVA table indicates that there is a statistically significant difference in the average number of years students attended a Northwest MN High School but it's really minor.
