    "text": "This research examined which factors most strongly influence whether individuals achieve meaningful employment within Northwestern Minnesota’s region (EDR 1, 2 & 4) after high school. Using both contingency table analysis (effect sizes, trends over 1, 5, and 10 years) and CART modeling, the goal was to identify which variables most reliably anchor individuals in the regional workforce versus those that push them toward statewide mobility, disconnection, or outmigration.\nA special focus was also placed on non-college graduates, who represent a substantial share of the region’s young adults and are at higher risk of disconnection from the labor force. Understanding their pathways provides additional insights into how to build a stronger, more inclusive regional workforce.\nThe findings provide a roadmap for education and workforce policy, showing how demographics, high school context, accomplishments, and postsecondary experiences interact to shape local labor market attachment."
