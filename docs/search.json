Each observation does not represent a unique, unduplicated individual, but rather a unique status for the individual. For example, one individual can have multiple observations if they changed schools, for each school year, or if their economic status changed in the middle of a school year.\nNext we need to create a dataset that only has students who graduated from a high school located in EDR 3.

I’m not sure why and this would be something to ask Meredith.\nMy goal is to join my standardized region and county code data with this document which will then be joined to the master enrollment document. Unfortunatley the main data does not include county name but rather their own code for county.

Here’s how I will do that.\n\nPersonID: change to integer\nK12OrganizationID: change to integer.\nK12EnrTimeID: Change so it’s only the year\nGrade: eliminate - unimportant since we are mostly concerned about whether they graduated.\nEconomicStatusIndicator: I will change this to two categories. Whether they were ever eligible for reduce priced or free meal will be coded as 1 (eligible = codes 1, 2, 4, 5) at any point in the dataset. The remaining will be coded as 0.\nFederalRaceIndicator: eliminate - I’m going to use the RaceEthnicity column instead.\nPSEO columns: I’m most concerned about whether they participated in PSEO or not. A new column will be created indicated whether there was a “Y” coded for either the “PSEOConcurrentEnrollmentIndicator” or “PostSecondaryEnrollmentOptionsIndicator” columns at any point in the dataset. The two original columns will be eliminated.\nStatusEnd: I will only include individuals that have StatusEnd coded as an 8 or 9.\nGender: included and not changed.\nSpecialEdStatus: I will split this into two categories. The first is that a student did not require special education services (codes 1-2) at any point in the dataset. The other category will be that they require special education (codes 4 - 9) at any point in the dataset.\nLimited English: keep with no changes.\nPrimary language: I’m going to create two categories. One being that English is the primary language while the other will be that English is NOT the primary language at any point in the dataset.\nHomeless: Keep with no changes.\n\nWe first need to create a list of all individuals with the StatusEnd code of 8 or 9 (graduated). In addition, we need to remove any student that graduated before 2008. This is because we will not have their full Sophmore - Senior records which is especially important when attempting to identify whether the number of CTE courses taken predicts migration.\nThe other element I want to add is a pre-covid and post-covid variable. All individuals whose grad year is before 2020 will be labeled pre-covid and all others wil lbe post-covid.\nThis “graduates list” will be the list on which we will bind all the other variables.\n\n\nNext we need to create new columns for the variables that will indicate a certain status has been met at any point in the dataset for each PersonID. For example, we want a column that indicates a PersonID was enrolled in PSEO at some point in the dataset. The variables that need a new column created are;\n\nEconomicStatusIndicator\nPostSecondaryEnrollmentOptionsIndicator & PSEOConcurrentEnrollmentIndicator\nSpecialEdStatus\nHomeprimaryLanguage\n\n\n\nNow we can combine the list of graduates with the status indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nK12OrganizationID\nOrganizationName\ncounty.name\ncountyfp\nDem_Desc\nedr\ngrad.year\ngrad.year.covid\nGender\nLimitedEnglishProficiencyIndicator\nHomelessIndicator\neconomic.status\npseo.participant\nSpecialEdStatus\nnon.english.home\nRaceEthnicity\n\n\n\n\n1621067\n140965\nPERHAM SENIOR HIGH\nOtter Tail\n111\nTown/rural mix\nEDR 4 - West Central\n2014\nPre-covid grad\nM\nN\nN\n0\n1\n0\n0\nWhite\n\n\n2500266\n150483\nEAST GRAND FORKS SENIOR HIGH\nPolk\n119\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 1 - Northwest\n2009\nPre-covid grad\nM\nN\nN\n0\nNA\n1\n0\nWhite\n\n\n5556115\n189828\nGREENBUSH-MIDDLE RIVER SENIOR HIGH\nRoseau\n135\nTown/rural mix\nEDR 1 - Northwest\n2020\nPost-covid grad\nM\nN\nN\n0\n0\n0\n0\nWhite\n\n\n1950620\n200829\nDETROIT LAKES SENIOR HIGH\nBecker\n005\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 4 - West Central\n2021\nPost-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n0\n0\n0\n0\nUnknown\n\n\n981116\n153538\nOSAKIS SECONDARY\nDouglas\n041\nTown/rural mix\nEDR 4 - West Central\n2010\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n1\n0\n0\n0\nWhite\n\n\n11991652\n75325\nBEMIDJI SENIOR HIGH\nBeltrami\n007\nTown/rural mix\nEDR 2 - Headwaters\n2009\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n0\nNA\n0\n0\nWhite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nK12OrganizationID\n\n\nOrganizationName\n\n\ncounty.name\n\n\ncountyfp\n\n\nDem_Desc\n\n\nedr\n\n\ngrad.year\n\n\ngrad.year.covid\n\n\nGender\n\n\nLimitedEnglishProficiencyIndicator\n\n\nHomelessIndicator\n\n\neconomic.status\n\n\npseo.participant\n\n\nSpecialEdStatus\n\n\nnon.english.home\n\n\nRaceEthnicity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prepped enrollment data has 32,629 observations and 17 columns.\n\n\n\nSummary of K12Enrollment data\nBelow is the percentage of total observations that;\n\nWere eligible for free or reduced lunch at some point in the dataset\nAre Female\nHave been homeless at some point in the dataset\nHad limited english proficiency at some point in the dataset\nHad non english speakders in home at some point in the dataset\nParticipated in a PSEO course at some point in the dataset.\nPct non white\n\nAs expected, nearly half (49.1%) of the observations are female.
